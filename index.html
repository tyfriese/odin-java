//string is java is always surrounded by quotes. 
//"are okay" 'are okay' `are okay`
//backticks `` allow us to embed variables and expressions into a string with ${...}
let name = "John";

//embed a variable
alert( `Hello, ${name}`); // you get alerted "Hello, John"

//embed an expression
alert(`the result is ${1+2}`); //you get alerted "the result is 3"


//Boolean (logical type) has only 2 values: True or False
//these are used as Yes/No values often. (Yes=True//No=False)
let nameFieldChecked = true;//means Yes, the name field is checked
let ageFieldChecked = false;//means No, the age field is not checked

//Boolean can answer comparisons as well
let isGreater = 4 > 1;
alert(isGreater);//alerted "true"

//"Null" is a special value that represents "nothing" "empty" or "value unknown"
let age = null;//means that the age is unknown



//"undefined" works just like null. The meaning of "undefined" is "value is not assigned"
//if a variable is declared but not assigned then its value is "undefined"
let age;

alert(age);//shows "undefined"
//you can technically assign "undefined" to a variable
let age = 100;
age = undefined;

alert(age); //"undefined"
//THIS IS NOT RECOMMENDED. NULL IS USED TO ASSIGN "EMPTY" OR "UNKNOWN" VALUES
//UNDEFINED IS RESERVED AS A DEFAULT INITIAL VALUE FOR UNASSIGNED THINGS




object //is SPECIAL
//all other types are considered primitive because they can only hold a single thing(string or number or whatver)
object //is used to store collections of data and more complex entities. 
//more to come on "object" later
symbol //is used to create unique indentifiers for objects.
//also more on that later whe nwe get into object more.


typeof //will return the actual type of the operand
typeof undefined // will spit out "undefined"

typeof 0 // will return "number"
typeof true //will return "boolean"
typeof "foo" //will return "string"
typeof alert //will reutrn "function"
typeof(alert)//works the same and will return "function"

// typeof x    IS MUCH MORE COMMON AND RECOMMENDED


//!!!!below is a Summary!!!!

//THERE ARE 8 BASIC DATA TYPES IN JAVA
// 7 PRIMITIVE TYPES
Number //for both floating and integers
BigInt // for integer numbers of arbitrary length
String //for strings(strings can have 0 or more characters, there is no separate single character type)
Boolean // for True/False
null // for UNKNOWN vlaues..a standalone type that has a single value "null"
undefined // for UNASSIGNED value..a standalone type that has a single value "undefined"
symbol //for unique identifiers 
//and one non-primitive type
object // for more complex data structures


typeof //operator shows which type is stored inside a variable



//deeper dive on strings
const goodString = "Use quotes to make strings";


const badString = no quotes;
const badString2 = 'single sided quote;
const badString3 = anything other than quotes really';
//browser will let you know what error(missing; before statement) or (unterminated string literal) 
//CANNOT USE TWO DIFFERENT CHARACTERS TO START/END A STRING
//IF YOU START WITH " THEN FINSIH WITH "
const badQuotes = 'This would not work";


//Remember that backticks `are used to embed java in them`
const name = "Chris";
const greeting = `Hello, ${name}`;
console.log(greeting); //will output "Hello, Chris"
//You can use the same technique to join 2 variables together.
const one = "Hello, ";
const two = "how are you?";
const joined = `${one}${two}`
console.log(joined); //outputs "Hello, how are you?"




//below is about concatenation in context




//the fucntion "prompt" will ask the user a question via a popup dialog box

//html--<button>Press me</button>
//html--<div id="greeting"></div>
const button = document.querySelector("button");

function greet() {
  const name = prompt("What is your name?");
  const greeting = document.querySelector("#greeting");
  greeting.textContent = `Hello ${name}, nice to see you!`;
}

button.addEventListener("click", greet);

//the + operator can concatenate normal string
const greeting = "helloo"
const name = "Chris"
console.log(greeting + ", " + name);//outputs "Hello, Chris"
//note the quotes in the middle are standing for a comma and a space between greeting and name


//expressions can be used inside strings just likle variables
const song = "Fight the Youth"
const score = 9;
const highestScore = 10;
const output = `I like the song ${song}. I gave it a score of ${(score/highestScore) * 100}%.`;
console.log(output);//should return "I like the song Fight The Youth. I gave it a score of 90%."




//MULTILINE STRINGS
//since Template literals(`backticks`) respect line breaks in source code, use mutliline strings
const newline = `One day you finally knew 
what you had to do, and began,`;
console.log(newline);
//should return WITH the line break. !!!HOLD 'SHIFT' AND HIT 'ENTER' TO LINE BREAK WITHOUT EXECUTING
// notice the backticks before. now lets use quotes
const newline = "One day you finally knew\nwhat you had to do, and began,";
console.log(newline);
//should output the same line break format as above. the \n represents a linebreak so you also do not need a space.



//you can also include quotes in your strings
//but since we use quotes to start strings
const badQuotes1 = "She said "I think so!"";//does NOT work
//comon option is to use the other characters (""   ''  ``)
constgoodQuote1 = 'She said "I think so!"';
const goodQuote2 = `She said "I'm not going in there!"`;

//another option is 'escaping' the quotation marks
//'escaping' means that we do something to them to make sure they are recognized as text, not part of the code.
//we do this by putting a BACKSLASH just before the character
const bigmouth = 'I\'ve got no right to take the throne...';
console.log(bigmouth)
//should output: "I've got no right to take the throne..."
//YOU CAN ALSO USE DIFFERENT CHARCTERS LIKE QUOTES OUTSIDE OF SINGLE QUOTES
const bigmouth = "I'VE GOT NO TIME FOR THIS"


//NUMBERS VS STRINGS

//when we try to concatenate strings and numbers they are converted to 2strings put together
const name = "Front ";
const number = 242;
console.log(name + number);
//should return "Front 242"
//note the space after front to get the space in the output

//you can convert any string into a number or number into a string using 1 of 2 functions
Number() 
String()
//example
const myString = "123";
const myNum = Number(myString);
console.log(typeof myNum);
//should output "number" with typeof function showing you TYPE it is
//OPPOSITE
const myNum2 = 123;
const myString2 = String(myNum2);
console.log(typeof myString2);
//should output string for same function reason as above in line 224

//more string methods!!! 
https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_string_methods.asp


//the 'length' property returns the length os a string
let text = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
let length = text.length;
console.log(length)
//should output "26"


//there are 3 methods to EXTRACTING string parts
slice(start, end) 
substring(start, end)
substr(start, length)

//SLICE extracts a part of a string and returns the extracted part in a new string
//this needs two parameters: start position and end position.(end not included)
let text = "Apple, Banana, Kiwi";
let part = text.slice(7,13);
console.log(part);
//should return "Banana"
//note that slice counts the first position as 0! 2nd position as 1!

//omitting the second parameter will slice out the rest of the string
let text = "Apple, Banana, Kiwi";
let part = text.slice(7);
console.log(part)
//should return "Banana"

let text = "Apple, Banana, Kiwi";
let part = text.slice(-12);
//using a negative COUNTS BACKWARD from the end of the string 
//output above should be "Banana, Kiwi"

let text = "Apple, Banana, Kiwi";
let part = text.slice(-12, -6);
//two negative act normally as this would slice out position -12 to position -6
//output should return "Banana"







//SUBSTRING() is similar to slice. 
//Difference is that start and end values less than 0 are treated as 0 in substring()
let str = "Apple, Banana, Kiwi";
let part = str.substring(7,13);
console.log(part);
//should return "Banana"
//substring extracts part of the string and returns it as a new string

//ommiting the second parameter causes the same action to happen (rest of string will be sliced out and returned)







//SUBSTR is another method and is very similar to slice

//
//the difference is that the second parameter specifies the LENGTH of the extracted part
let test = "Apple, Banana, Kiwi";
let part = test.substr(7,6);
console.log(part); 
//should return "Banana"
//It took the 6 characters from the 7th position(B) to get Banana


//much like slice, omitting the 2nd parameter slices out the rest of the string.
let str = "Apple, Banana, Kiwi";
let part = str.substr(7);
//should return "Banana, Kiwi"

//and again, much like slice, if the parameter is negative then it counts from the end of the string.
let str = "Apple, Banana, Kiwi"
let part = str.substr(-4);
console.log(part);
//should return "Kiwi"






//REPLACING STRING CONTENT
replace() //is a method that replaces a specified value with another value in a string

let text = "Please visit microsoft and microsoft!"
let newText = text.replace("microsoft", "w3Schools");
//shoudl return "Please visit w3Schools and microsoft!"
//look at notes below as to why it did not change both

//NOTE: the replace() method does not change the string it is called on
//NOTE: the replace() method returns a new string
//NOTE: the replace() method replaces ONLY THE FIRST match
//default: is set to only replace the FIRST MATCH
//default: replace() method is case sensitive[writing 'MICROSOFT' would not work]



//TO REPLACE ALL MATCHES, use a regular expression with a /g flag (global)
let text = "Please visit Microsoft and Microsoft!";
let newText = text.replace(/Microsoft/g, "W3Schools");
//should return "Please visit w3Schools and w3Schools"


//you can replace case insensitive using a 'regular expression' with an /i flag (insensitive)
let text = "Please visit Microsoft!";
let newText = text.replace(/MICROSOFT/i, "w3Schools");
//should return "Please visit w3Schools"


//REGULAR EXPRESSIONS are written without quotes but we will learn more about them later on.
