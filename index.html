//string is java is always surrounded by quotes. 
//"are okay" 'are okay' `are okay`
//backticks `` allow us to embed variables and expressions into a string with ${...}
let name = "John";

//embed a variable
alert( `Hello, ${name}`); // you get alerted "Hello, John"

//embed an expression
alert(`the result is ${1+2}`); //you get alerted "the result is 3"


//Boolean (logical type) has only 2 values: True or False
//these are used as Yes/No values often. (Yes=True//No=False)
let nameFieldChecked = true;//means Yes, the name field is checked
let ageFieldChecked = false;//means No, the age field is not checked

//Boolean can answer comparisons as well
let isGreater = 4 > 1;
alert(isGreater);//alerted "true"

//"Null" is a special value that represents "nothing" "empty" or "value unknown"
let age = null;//means that the age is unknown



//"undefined" works just like null. The meaning of "undefined" is "value is not assigned"
//if a variable is declared but not assigned then its value is "undefined"
let age;

alert(age);//shows "undefined"
//you can technically assign "undefined" to a variable
let age = 100;
age = undefined;

alert(age); //"undefined"
//THIS IS NOT RECOMMENDED. NULL IS USED TO ASSIGN "EMPTY" OR "UNKNOWN" VALUES
//UNDEFINED IS RESERVED AS A DEFAULT INITIAL VALUE FOR UNASSIGNED THINGS




object //is SPECIAL
//all other types are considered primitive because they can only hold a single thing(string or number or whatver)
object //is used to store collections of data and more complex entities. 
//more to come on "object" later
symbol //is used to create unique indentifiers for objects.
//also more on that later whe nwe get into object more.


typeof //will return the actual type of the operand
typeof undefined // will spit out "undefined"

typeof 0 // will return "number"
typeof true //will return "boolean"
typeof "foo" //will return "string"
typeof alert //will reutrn "function"
typeof(alert)//works the same and will return "function"

// typeof x    IS MUCH MORE COMMON AND RECOMMENDED


//!!!!below is a Summary!!!!

//THERE ARE 8 BASIC DATA TYPES IN JAVA
// 7 PRIMITIVE TYPES
Number //for both floating and integers
BigInt // for integer numbers of arbitrary length
String //for strings(strings can have 0 or more characters, there is no separate single character type)
Boolean // for True/False
null // for UNKNOWN vlaues..a standalone type that has a single value "null"
undefined // for UNASSIGNED value..a standalone type that has a single value "undefined"
symbol //for unique identifiers 
//and one non-primitive type
object // for more complex data structures


typeof //operator shows which type is stored inside a variable



//deeper dive on strings
const goodString = "Use quotes to make strings";


const badString = no quotes;
const badString2 = 'single sided quote;
const badString3 = anything other than quotes really';
//browser will let you know what error(missing; before statement) or (unterminated string literal) 
//CANNOT USE TWO DIFFERENT CHARACTERS TO START/END A STRING
//IF YOU START WITH " THEN FINSIH WITH "
const badQuotes = 'This would not work";


//Remember that backticks `are used to embed java in them`
const name = "Chris";
const greeting = `Hello, ${name}`;
console.log(greeting); //will output "Hello, Chris"
//You can use the same technique to join 2 variables together.
const one = "Hello, ";
const two = "how are you?";
const joined = `${one}${two}`
console.log(joined); //outputs "Hello, how are you?"




//below is about concatenation in context




//the fucntion "prompt" will ask the user a question via a popup dialog box

//html--<button>Press me</button>
//html--<div id="greeting"></div>
const button = document.querySelector("button");

function greet() {
  const name = prompt("What is your name?");
  const greeting = document.querySelector("#greeting");
  greeting.textContent = `Hello ${name}, nice to see you!`;
}

button.addEventListener("click", greet);

//the + operator can concatenate normal string
const greeting = "helloo"
const name = "Chris"
console.log(greeting + ", " + name);//outputs "Hello, Chris"
//note the quotes in the middle are standing for a comma and a space between greeting and name


//expressions can be used inside strings just likle variables
const song = "Fight the Youth"
const score = 9;
const highestScore = 10;
const output = `I like the song ${song}. I gave it a score of ${(score/highestScore) * 100}%.`;
console.log(output);//will return "I like the song Fight The Youth. I gave it a score of 90%."




//MULTILINE STRINGS
//since Template literals(`backticks`) respect line breaks in source code, use mutliline strings
const newline = `One day you finally knew 
what you had to do, and began,`;
console.log(newline);
//will return WITH the line break. !!!HOLD 'SHIFT' AND HIT 'ENTER' TO LINE BREAK WITHOUT EXECUTING
// notice the backticks before. now lets use quotes
const newline = "One day you finally knew\nwhat you had to do, and began,";
console.log(newline);
//should output the same line break format as above. the \n represents a linebreak so you also do not need a space.



//you can also include quotes in your strings
//but since we use quotes to start strings
const badQuotes1 = "She said "I think so!"";//does NOT work
//comon option is to use the other characters (""   ''  ``)
constgoodQuote1 = 'She said "I think so!"';
const goodQuote2 = `She said "I'm not going in there!"`;

//another option is 'escaping' the quotation marks
//'escaping' means that we do something to them to make sure they are recognized as text, not part of the code.
//we do this by putting a BACKSLASH just before the character
const bigmouth = 'I\'ve got no right to take the throne...';
console.log(bigmouth)
//should output: "I've got no right to take the throne..."
//YOU CAN ALSO USE DIFFERENT CHARCTERS LIKE QUOTES OUTSIDE OF SINGLE QUOTES
const bigmouth = "I'VE GOT NO TIME FOR THIS"


//NUMBERS VS STRINGS

//when we try to concatenate strings and numbers they are converted to 2strings put together
const name = "Front ";
const number = 242;
console.log(name + number);
//will return "Front 242"
//note the space after front to get the space in the output

//you can convert any string into a number or number into a string using 1 of 2 functions
Number() 
String()
//example
const myString = "123";
const myNum = Number(myString);
console.log(typeof myNum);
//should output "number" with typeof function showing you TYPE it is
//OPPOSITE
const myNum2 = 123;
const myString2 = String(myNum2);
console.log(typeof myString2);
//should output string for same function reason as above in line 224

//more string methods!!! 
https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_string_methods.asp


//the 'length' property returns the length os a string
let text = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
let length = text.length;
console.log(length)
//should output "26"


//there are 3 methods to EXTRACTING string parts
slice(start, end) 
substring(start, end)
substr(start, length)

//SLICE extracts a part of a string and returns the extracted part in a new string
//this needs two parameters: start position and end position.(end not included)
let text = "Apple, Banana, Kiwi";
let part = text.slice(7,13);
console.log(part);
//will return "Banana"
//note that slice counts the first position as 0! 2nd position as 1!

//omitting the second parameter will slice out the rest of the string
let text = "Apple, Banana, Kiwi";
let part = text.slice(7);
console.log(part)
//will return "Banana"

let text = "Apple, Banana, Kiwi";
let part = text.slice(-12);
//using a negative COUNTS BACKWARD from the end of the string 
//output above should be "Banana, Kiwi"

let text = "Apple, Banana, Kiwi";
let part = text.slice(-12, -6);
//two negative act normally as this would slice out position -12 to position -6
//output will return "Banana"







//SUBSTRING() is similar to slice. 
//Difference is that start and end values less than 0 are treated as 0 in substring()
let str = "Apple, Banana, Kiwi";
let part = str.substring(7,13);
console.log(part);
//will return "Banana"
//substring extracts part of the string and returns it as a new string

//ommiting the second parameter causes the same action to happen (rest of string will be sliced out and returned)







//SUBSTR is another method and is very similar to slice

//
//the difference is that the second parameter specifies the LENGTH of the extracted part
let test = "Apple, Banana, Kiwi";
let part = test.substr(7,6);
console.log(part); 
//will return "Banana"
//It took the 6 characters from the 7th position(B) to get Banana


//much like slice, omitting the 2nd parameter slices out the rest of the string.
let str = "Apple, Banana, Kiwi";
let part = str.substr(7);
//will return "Banana, Kiwi"

//and again, much like slice, if the parameter is negative then it counts from the end of the string.
let str = "Apple, Banana, Kiwi"
let part = str.substr(-4);
console.log(part);
//will return "Kiwi"






//REPLACING STRING CONTENT
replace() //is a method that replaces a specified value with another value in a string

let text = "Please visit microsoft and microsoft!"
let newText = text.replace("microsoft", "w3Schools");
//shoudl return "Please visit w3Schools and microsoft!"
//look at notes below as to why it did not change both

//NOTE: the replace() method does not change the string it is called on
//NOTE: the replace() method returns a new string
//NOTE: the replace() method replaces ONLY THE FIRST match
//default: is set to only replace the FIRST MATCH
//default: replace() method is case sensitive[writing 'MICROSOFT' would not work]



//TO REPLACE ALL MATCHES, use a regular expression with a /g flag (global)
let text = "Please visit Microsoft and Microsoft!";
let newText = text.replace(/Microsoft/g, "W3Schools");
//will return "Please visit w3Schools and w3Schools"


//you can replace case insensitive using a 'regular expression' with an /i flag (insensitive)
let text = "Please visit Microsoft!";
let newText = text.replace(/MICROSOFT/i, "w3Schools");
//will return "Please visit w3Schools"


//REGULAR EXPRESSIONS are written without quotes but we will learn more about them later on.



//REPLACEALL() method
let text = "I love cats. Cats are so cool and fun. Cats are soft"
text = text.replaceAll("cats","dogs");
text = text.replaceAll("Cats","Dogs");
//will return "I love dogs. Dogs are so cool and fun. Dogs are soft"
//note I did it for both capitalized versions and lowercase versions

//replaceAll() method allows you to specify a regular expression instead of a string to be replaced
//if the parameter is a regular expression, the global flag(g) must be set. otherwise:ERROR
text = text.replaceAll(/Cats/g,"Dogs")
text = text.replaceAll(/cats/g,"dogs")
//NOTE: replaceAll() does NOT work on Internet Explorer.






//Java string to uppercase or lower case
toUpperCase()
toLowerCase()

let text1 = "Hello World!";
let text2 = text1.toUpperCase();
console.log(text2)
//will return "HELLO WORLD!"

let text1 = "Good Day Here Mate!";
let text2 = text1.toLowerCase();
console.log(text2);
//will return "good day here mate"







//JAVA STRING CONCAT()
concat() //joins two or more strings

let text1 = "Hello";
let text2 = "world!";
let text3 = text1.concat(" ", text2)
//will return "Hello World!"
//note, again, the space inbetween the quotes 

//concat() can be used instead of the + operator
text = "Hello" + " " + "World!"; //note the quotes around each operand
text = "Hello".concat(" ", "World!");
console.log(text)
//both will return "Hello World!"

//NOTE: ALL STRING METHODS RETURN A NEW STRING. THEY DO NOT MODIFY THE ORIGINAL STRING
//Strings are immutable: Strings cannot be changed, only replaced.





//JAVA STRING TRIM()
trim() //method removes whitespace from both sides of a string

let text1 = "         Hello World!      ";
let text2 = text1.trim();
console.log(text2);
//will return "Hello World";
console.log(text1);
//will return "         Hello World!      "

trimStart() //method works like trim(), but removes whitespaces only from the start of the string
let text1 = "       Hello World!       ";
let text2 = text1.trimStart();
console.log(text2)
//will return "Hello World           "

trimEnd() // works just the opposite and removes whitespaces from the end of the string

let text1 = "    Hello World!       ";
let text2 = text1.trimEnd();
console.log(text2)
//will return "      Hello World!"






//JAVA STRING PADDING
padStart()
padEnd()
//were both added to support padding at the beginning and at the end of a string
//this pads the string with another string(multiple times) until it reaches a given length. 

//example: pad a string with "0" until it reaches the length 4:
let text = "5";
let padded = text.padStart(4,"0");
console.log(padded);
//will return "0005"

//pad a string with "x" until it reaches the length 4:
let text = "5";
let padded = text.padStart(4,"x");
console.log(padded);
//will return "xxx5"


//padStart() and padEnd() are string methods. meaning to pad a number, you must convert that number to a string first
let numb = 5
let text = numb.toString();
let padded = text.padStart(4,"0");
console.log(padded);
//will return "0005"

//padEnd() is not supported in Internet Explorer





// Extracting String Characters
//3 methods for extracting string characters:
charAt 
charCodeAt
Property access []


charAt // method returns the character at a specified index (position) in a string:
let text = "Hello World!";
let char = text.charAt(0);
console.log(char);
//will return "H"
//charAt (character at) [remember that the first position is 0]


charCodeAt() //method returns the unicode of the character at a specified index in a string
//the method returns a UTF-16 code (an integer between 0 and 65535)
let text = "Hello World!";
let char = text.charCodeAt(0);
console.log(char);
//will return "72"
//more on unicode in the doc below:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String



[...] // allows property access [] on strings.

let text = "Hello World!";
let char = text[0];
console.log(char)
//will return "H"
//meaning the first character (0)
//NOTE: PROPERTY ACCESS IS A LITTLE UNPREDICTABLE
//- it makes strings look like arrays (they are not)
//- if no chartacter is found, [] returns undefined, (while charAt returns an empty string)
// - it is read only. str[0]="A" gives no error (but does not work)
let text = "HELLO WORLD";
text[0] = "A";
//gives no error but does not work







//CONVERTING A STRING TO AN ARRAY
//like converting numbers, if you want to work with strings as an array, you must convert it to an array

//JAVA STRING SPLIT() METHOD
split() //can be used to convert strings to arrays

text.split(",") //means to Split on commas
text.split(" ") //means to Split on spaces
text.split("|") //means to Split on pipe


let text = "a,b,c,d,e,f";
const myArray = text.split(",");
console.log(myArray[0]);
//returns "a"
//NOTE that the [] after myArray specifies which character
//console.log(myArray); would return "a b c d e f" 


//REMEMBER! JavaScript treats strings as objects when executing methods and properties.


charAt()	//Returns the character at a specified index (position)
charCodeAt()	//Returns the Unicode of the character at a specified index

//COMPARISONS
//we know many comparison operators in math:    greater than, less than, equals to
//they are written as the following in Java:
a > b, a < b
a >= b, a <= b //"greater than or equals to", "less than or equals to"
a == b //NOTE  THE DOUBLE EQUALS MEANS THE EQUALITY TEST/ NOT AN ASSIGNMENT LIKE SINLGE =
a != b //means "NOT equals to" in Java

//BY THE END, YOU SHOULD FIND A GOOD RECIPE TO AVOID "JAVASCRIPT QUIRKS"-RELATED ISSUES

//COMPARISON operators return a boolean value.(see line 47 for boolean)
alert(2>1);
//will return "true"
alert(2==1);
//will return "false"
alert(2!=1);
//will return "true"


//a COMPARISON result can be assigned to a varibale, just like any value.
let result = 5>4;
alert(result);
//will return "true"





////STRING COMPARSION 
//To see whether a string is greater than another, Java uses the so-called "dictionary" or "lexicographical" order
//in other words strings are compared letter-by-letter
EXAMPLE1: alert ( 'Z' > 'A' );
//will return "true"
EXAMPLE 2: alert( 'Glow' > 'Glee' );
//will return "true"
 EXAMPLE 3: alert( 'Bee' > 'Be' );
//will return "true"

//ASKING WHY?^?^?
//The algorithm to compare two strings is simple:
// 1- Compare the first character of both strings.
// 2- If the first character from the first string is greater (or less) than the other string’s, then the first string is greater (or less) than the second. We’re done.
// 3- Otherwise, if both strings’ first characters are the same, compare the second characters the same way.
// 4- Repeat until the end of either string.
// 5- If both strings end at the same length, then they are equal. Otherwise, the longer string is greater.
EXAMPLE2: G is the same as G.
l is the same as l.
o is greater than e. Stop here. The first string is greater.



//  NOTE : ANY VALUE THAT IS NOT 'FALSE', 'UNDEFINED', 'NULL', '0', 'NaN', or an empty string ("") reutrns true!




//When comparing values of different types, Java converts them to numbers.
alert( '2' > 1); 
//will return "true". because string becomes a number in java^^^^
alert( '01' == 1 );
//will return "true". becuase the string'01' becomes a number 1.

//BOOLEAN VALUES BECOME NUMBERS AS WELL. true is equal to 1. false is equal to 0
alert( true==1 );
//will return "true"
alert( false == 0);
//will return "true"





//STRICT EQUALITY
//a regular equality check (==) has a problem. It CANNOT differentiate 0 from false.
alert( 0 == false);
//will return "true"
alert( '' == false);
//will return "true"
//NOTE: this happens becuase operands are converted to numbers by the ==. 
//An empty string, just like "false", becomes a zero.


//to differentiate 0 from false. use a STRICT EQUALITY(===) operator.
// === checks the equality without type conversion.
//in other words, if a and b are of different types, then a === b immediately returns "false" without an attempt to convert them
alert( 0 === false );
//will return "false". because the types are different.


//NOTE: THERE IS A 'STRICT NON-EQUALITY' OPERATOR. !== 
// The 'strict non-equality' makes it obvious whats going on, leaving less room for errors.





//COMPARISONS with null and undefined;
alert( null === undefined );
//will return "false". because they are two different types.
alert( null == undefined );
//will return "true". becuase these two have a "sweet couple" relationship
//NOTE:they equal each other in the sense of == but not any other value.

//for maths and other comparisons (<, >, <=, >=), null12 and undefined are converted to numbers.
//NULL becomes 0. UNDEFINED becomes NaN(not a number)0

alert( null > 0 );  
//will return "false"
alert( null == 0 ); 
// will return "false"
alert( null >= 0 ); 
// will return "true"

//Mathematically, that’s strange. The last result states that "null is greater than or equal to zero", so in one of the comparisons above it must be true, but they are both false.
//The reason is that an equality check == and comparisons > < >= <= work differently. Comparisons convert null to a number, treating it as 0. That’s why (3) null >= 0 is true and (1) null > 0 is false.
//On the other hand, the equality check == for undefined and null is defined such that, without any conversions, they equal each other and don’t equal anything else. That’s why (2) null == 0 is false.





//AN INCOMPARABLE UNDEFINED
//the value 'undefined' shouldn't be compared to other values:
alert( undefined > 0 ); 
// will return "false"
alert( undefined < 0 ); 
// will return "false" 
alert( undefined == 0 ); 
// will return "false" 

//NOTE: 1st and 2nd example are false becuase undefined gets converted to NaN(which returns false for all comparisons)
//NOTE: 3rd example equality check returns false because 'undefined' only equals 'null', 'defined', and no other value.





//THESE STRANGE EXAMPLES WILL COME UP ENOUGH TO BECOME FAMILIAR OVER TIME. USE THESE TO AVOID PROBLEMS WITH THEM:
// 
//Treat any comparison with undefined/null except the strict equality (===) with exceptional care.
//Don’t use comparisons >=, >, <, <= with a variable which may be null/undefined, unless you’re really sure of what you’re doing. If a variable can have these values, check for them separately.
















//!CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS!//
////////////////////////////
if
else
else if
switch
//are the 4 conditional statements.
//conditional statements perform different actions for different decisions when you write code.
if //is used to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true.
else //is used to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false.
else if //is used to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false.
switch //is used to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed.




//Use 'if' statements to specify a block of Java to be executed uf the condition is true
if(condition) {
  //input block of code to be executed if true
}
//NOTE: that 'if' is lowercase. capital letters 'IF' will result in error
//ex) making a 'good day' greeting if the hour is less than 18:00:
if (hour < 18) {
  greeting = "Good day";
}
//note that 'hour' must be defined first (or whatever you're including in the condition)




//use the 'else' statement to specify a block of code to be executred if the condition is false. 
if(condition) {
  //block to be executed if true
} else {
  //block of code to be executed if the condition is false
}
///////
if(hour<18) {
  greeting = "Good Day!"
} else {
  greeting = "Good Evening!"
}
//result now has 2 options to choose from with else meaning "if hour<18 is false"





//use the 'else if' statement to specify a new condition if the first condition is false
if(condition1) {
  //block to be executed is true
} else if(condition2) {
  //block of code to be executed if the 'condition1' is false and 'condition2' is true
} else {
  //block to be executed if condition 1 AND 2 are false
}
/////////////
if (time < 10) {
  greeting = "Good Morning!"
} else if (time < 20) {
  greeting = "Good Day!"
} else {
  greeting {
    greeting = "Good Evening!";
}
//result will depend on the time of day you look at but you can see multiple conditions being looked at.











///////////LOGICAL OPERATORS(there are 4 logical operators in Java)
|| (OR) (lines 833-899)
&& (AND) (lines 907-962)
! (NOT) (line 971-1000)
?? (Nullish Coalescing)
//Although they are called “logical”, they can be applied to values of any type, not only boolean. Their result can also be of any type.




//the OR operator is represented with two vertical line symbols:
result = a || b;

//Java makes the || a little trickier and more powerful than classic programming
//there are four possible logical combos:
alert( true || true);  //true
alert( flase || true);  //true
alert ( true || false );  //true
alert( false || false);  //false
//the result is always true except for the case when both operands are false
//if an operand is not a boolean, it is converted to one for the evaluation
//remember that 1=true and 0=false
if (1 || 0) {  //this works just like 'if (true||false)'
  alert( 'the truth!')
} //this should alert your screen "the truth!"

//NOTE: || (or) is used inside of an 'if' statement to test if any of the given conditions is true.
let hour = 9;

if (hour < 10 || hour > 18) {
  alert('the office is closed');
} // translation:  if the hour is less than 10(1000) OR the hour is greater than 18(1800)

//we can pass more conditions also
let hour = 12;
let isWeekend = true;

if (hour < 10 || hour > 18 || isWeekend) {
  alert('The Office is closed.'); 
}
// ||(or) find the first truthy value
result = value1 || value2 || value3;
// the ||(or) opertor does the following:
//evaluates operands from left to right
//for each operand, converts it to boolean, if the result is 'true', stops and returns the original value of that operand 
//if all operands have been evaluated (were all false), it will return the last operand.
//NOTE: a value is returned in its original form without the conversion.

//      A CHAIN OF || WILL RETURN THE FIRST TRUTHY VALUE. OR THE LAST VALUE IF NO TRUTHY VALUES ARE FOUND. 
alert( 1 || 0);
 // will return '1' (1 is truthy)
alert( null || 1);
//will return '1' becuase 1 is the first truthy value
alert( null || 0 || 1);
//will return '1', becuase 1 is the first truthy value
alert( undefined || null || 0); 
// will return 0, because it reads left to right and all were false, returning 0(the last value)

//THIS WILL LEAD TO INTERESTING USAGE
//    1) GETTING THE FIRST TRUTHY VALUE FROM A LIST OF VARIABLES OR EXPRESSIONS
let firstName = "";
let lastName = "";
let nickName = "SuperCoder";

alert( firstName || lastName || nickName || "Anonymous");
// will return "SuperCoder" . but if all variables were falsy, then "Anonymous" would be returned

//      2) SHORT CIRCUIT EVALUATION
// the || operator is the so-called "short-circuit" evaluation
// This means that || processes its arguments until the first truthy value is reached, and then the value is returned immediately, without even touching the other argument
// This becomes important when the operand isn't just a value, but is an expression with a side effect(variable assignment or function call)

true || alert("not printed");
false || alert("printed");
//only the second message would be alerted
// WHY? in the first line, the || stops evaluating upon seeing true, so the alert is not run
// people use this feature to execute commands only if the condition on the left part is falsy







/////// The && (AND) operator represented by two ampersands. &&
result = a && b;
//in classical programming, &&(AND) returns 'true' if both operands are truthy and 'false' otherwise
alert( true && true);
// will return 'true'
alert( false && true);
//will return 'false'
alert( true && false);
//will return 'false'
alert( false && false);
//will return 'false';
//NOTE: BOTH side must be truthy in order to return 'true'

//example using an 'if' statement

let hour = 12;
let minute = 30;

if (hour == 12 && minute == 30) {
  alert('The time is 12:30');
} // this will alert the screen 'The time is 12:30'

//just like with ||(OR), any value is allowed as an operand of &&(AND)
if (1 && 0) { //<<<<this is evaluated as 'true and false'
  alert("won't work, because the result is falsy")
}

// NOTE!!!: &&(AND) find the first falsy value
result = value1 && value2 && value3;
// NOTE: THE &&(AND) OPERATOR DOES THE FOLLOWING:
// Evaluates from left to right
// for each operand, converts it to a boolean. if the result is 'false' then it stops and returns the original value of the operand
// if all operands have been evaluated (were all truthy), it returns the last operand

// IN OTHER WORDS!!!   &&(AND) RETURNS THE FIRST FALSY VALUE OR THE LAST VALUE (IF NONE WERE FOUND)

//if the first operand is truthy. then &&(AND) will return the second operand:
alert( 1 && 0); //will return '0'
alert ( 1 && 5);// will return '5'

//if the first operand if falsy, then &&(AND) returns it and ignores the second
alert( null && 5); // will return 'null'
alert(0 && "no matter what"); //will return '0' / because the first value is falsy

// GOOD TO NOTE THAT THE PRECEDENCE OF &&(AND) IS HIGHER THAN ||(OR)
// so the code a && b || c && d is just like saying (a && b) || (c && d)

//DO NOT REPLACE 'if' WITH || or &&
let x = 1;
(x > 0) && alert('greater than zero');
// the action on the right side of the && only gets executed if the evaluations reaches it (only if x>0)
//the above is basically an analogue for:
let x = 1;
if (x > 0) alert('greater than zero');
// Although the variat with && appears shorter, 'if' is more obvious and more readable
//RECOMMENDED THAT WE USE CONTRUCT FOR THEIR PURPOSE (IF WHEN YOU WANT IF...&& IF YOU WANT AND)








/////////////The !(NOT) operator is represented with a exclamation sign!
result = !value;
//The operator accepts a single arguement and does the following:
// 1) converts the operand to boolean type.
// 2) returns the inverse value
alert( !true ); // will return 'false'
alert ( !0 ); //will return 'true'

// NOTE: a double not, !!, is sometimes used for converting a value to boolean type.
alert( !!"non-empty string"); //will return 'true'
alert( !!null); //will return 'false'. becuase the boolean value of null is returned

// The first NOT ! converts the value to boolean and returns the inverse
// The second NOT ! inverses it again. In the end, we have a plain vlaue-to-boolean conversion.

// There is a more verbose way to do the same thing. Like a built-in boolean function.
alert( Boolean("non-empty string")); // will return 'true'
alert(Boolean(null)); // will return 'false'

//The precenedence of !(NOT) is the highest of all logical operators, so it is ALWAYS executed first. before &&, before ||


//example problem: write an 'if' condition to check that 'age' is between 14 and 90 inclusively 
if ( age >= 14 && age <= 90 )
//inclusively means that age can reach the edges 14 or 90. hence the <= >=


//ex problem: write an 'if' condition to check that age is NOT between 14 and 90.
if (! (age 14 && age > 90));
if (age <14 || age > 90);


//ex problem: write a code which asks for login with 'prompt'
//visitor will enter "admin", then 'prompt' for a password
//if the input is an empty line or 'Esc'-show  "cancelled", if its another string- show "i dont know you"
//password is checked as follows: 
// - if it equals "TheMaster", then show "Welcome!"
// - another string- show "Wrong password"
// - for an empty string or cancelled input, show "Cancelled"
// empty string "", pressing 'Esc' returns null


let userName = prompt("Who's there?", "");

/////BELOW IS ABOUT SWITCH STATEMENTS
// if...else statements do the job well when you have a couple of choices, and each requires a reasonable amount of code to be run and/or has mutliple logical operators
// when you only want to set a certain choice of value or print a particular statement dpending on a condition use switch
// Switch statements take a single expression/value as an input, and then looks through several choices until they find one that matches the value. and then executes it
switch (expression) {
  case choice1:
    //run this code
    break;

  case choice2: 
  //run this code instead
  break;

  case choice3:
    //include as many cases as you would like

  default:
    //actually, just run this code
    break;
}
// ABOVE EXPLANATION:
// - keyword of 'switch' followed by parentheses ()
// - an expression inside the parentheses ()
// - keyword of 'case', followed by a choice that the expression/value could be
// - some code to run[only if the value matches]
// - a 'break' statement, followed by a semicolon; 
// - if the previous choice matches the expression/value, the browser stops executing the code block there
// - and then moves on to any code that appears below the  switch (statement) { }
// - remember you can add as many cases as you want/need
// - the keyword 'default', followed by a code pattern but DOES NOT have a choice afer it
// - the DEFAULT option does not need a break after it as there is nothing to run after it
// - the DEFAULT option will run if none of the above codes match
// - NOTE: you also do not need to include a default section. UNLESS you are handling unknown cases

//test from lesson:
//Active learning: A simple calendar
//In this example, you are going to help us finish a simple calendar application. In the code you've got:
//A <select> element to allow the user to choose between different months.
//An 'onchange' event handler to detect when the value selected in the <select> menu is changed.
//A function called 'createCalendar()'' that draws the calendar and displays the correct month in the h1 element.

//We need you to write a conditional statement inside the 'onchange' handler function, just below the // ADD CONDITIONAL HERE comment. It should:

//Look at the selected month (stored in the 'choice' variable. This will be the <select> element value after the value changes, so "January" for example.)
//Set a variable called 'days' to be equal to the number of days in the selected month. To do this you'll have to look up the number of days in each month of the year. You can ignore leap years for the purposes of this example.
//Hints:
//You are advised to use logical OR to group multiple months together into a single condition; many of them share the same number of days.
//Think about which number of days is the most common, and use that as a default value.

let days = 31;
  if (choice === "February") {
    days = 28;

  ////TEST 2 FROM LESSON:

// - This should accept the choice variable as its input expression
// - for each case the choice should equal one of the possible <option> values (white, black, purple, yellow, or psychedelic)
// - also for each case: the 'update()' function should be run and be passed two color values. 1 for bgColor and the second for textcolor
// - color value are strings so they must be wrapped in "quotes"

// DOM change breakpoints (elements tab) has 3 options to click from when you expand it from the right click menu
subtree modifications: //Triggered when a child of the currently-selected node is removed 
//or added, or the contents of a child are changed. Not triggered on child node attribute

//NOTE THAT THE VALUES ARE SPECIFICS




monitor(function)
//When the function specified is called, a message is logged to the console that indicates 
//the function name along with the arguments that are passed to the function when it was called.
/* REMEMBER TO USE*/ unmonitor(function) //to stop monitoring



monitorEvents(object[,events])
//when a specified event occurs on the specified object, the Eventis logged to the console.
monitorEvents(window, "resize");
//will log every time the window gets resized

//note that you can add to the events
monitorEvents(window, ["resize","scroll"])
// you can also specify one of the available event "types", strings that map to predefined sets of events.

//all mouse types
"mousedown", "mouseup", "click", "dblclick", "mousemove", "mouseover", "mouseout", "mousewheel"

//all key types
"keydown", "keyup", "keypress", "textInput"

//all touch types
"touchstart", "touchmove", "touchend", "touchcancel"

//all control types
"resize", "scroll", "zoom", "focus", "blur", "select", "change", "submit", "reset"





monitorEvents($0, "key");
// uses the "key" event type. All corresponding key events on an input text field currently selected($0)

/* REMEMBER TO USE */ unmonitorEvents(object[,events]) //to stop monitoring something





profile([name]) /*and*/ profileEnd([name])
//profile()starts a javascript CPU profiling session with an optional name. 
// profileEnd() completes the profile and diplays the results in the 'Performance > Main' track
//note that these are the shorthand for 'console.profile()' and 'console.profileEnd()'

//to start profiling:
profile("Profile 1")

//to stop profiling and see results in the 'Performance > Main' track
profileEnd("Profile 1")



queryObjects(Constructor)
//call this from the console to return an array of objects that were created with the specified constructor
queryObjects(promise) //returns every instance of 'promise'
queryObjects(HTMLElement) //returns all HTML elements
queryObjects(foo) // returns all objects that were instantiated via the class foo()



table(data[,columns])
//logs an object data with table formatting by passing in a data object in with optional column headings
/*above is a shortcut for*/ console.table()
//example:
let names = [
  {firstName: "John", lastName: "Smith"},
  {firstName: "Jane", lastName: "Doe"},
];
table(names);
//would display a table of the names with columns of (index), "first", "last", and any other info you have declared



undebug(function)
//stops the debugging of the specified function so that when the function is called
/*the debugger no longer is invoked. This is also used in concert wih*/ debug(fn)

unmonitor(function)
// stops the monitoring of the specified function. 
/* this is used in concert with */ monitor(fn)


unmonitorEvents(objects [,events])
// stops monitoring events for the specified object and events. 
unmonitorEvents(window)
//above will stop all event monitoring on the window object

//note that you can also stop specific events on an object
monitorEvents($0, "mouse");
unmonitorEvents($0, "mousemove");
//will start monitoring all 'mouse' events on the current selected element($0)
// this will also stop monitoring "mousemove" events (probably to reduce the noise in the output)








// more devtools tips


//regular
console.log('hello');

//Interpolated
console.log('hello I am a %s string!, '')
//interpolates whatever is in the second '', into the %s
//not used much since backticks can input varriables inside `` 

//styled
console.log('%c I am some good text', 'font-size: 50px')
//will style the text css style


//warning
console.warn('ohnoo');
//will return a warning on the console

//error
console.error('oh nooo')
//displays an error in the console


//info
console.info('Crocs eat 3-4 people per year')
//returns an 'info' line in the console


//testing
console.assert(1 === 2, 'You did not select the right element')
//assert only fires when something returns false(and then it will tell you in the console)
//This allows you to test for anything, and if it is wrong then it will tell the user in the console


//cleaning
console.clear()


//viewing DOM elements
console.log(p); //logs the dropdown
console.dir(p); //allows you to open the class list to show anything that lives on the element



//grouping
dogs.forEach(dog => {
  console.group(`${dog.name}`);
  console.log(`This is ${dog.name}`)
  console.log(`${dog.name} is ${dog.age * 7}dog years old`)
  console.groupEnd(`${dog.name}`);
})
//this is all a lot of stuff and a mess so the console.group cleans it up a bit



//counting
console.count('Wes');
console.count('Wes');
console.count('Wes');
console.count('Steve');
console.count('Steve');
console.count('Wes');
console.count('Wes');
console.count('Wes');
console.count('Steve');
console.count('Steve');
console.count('Wes');
console.count('Wes');
console.count('Wes');

//will log how many you have iterated over the code
/*wes 1
  wes 2
  wes 3
  steve 1
  steve 2
  wes 4 
  and so on */



  //timing
  console.time('fetching data');
  fetch('https://api.github.com/users/webos')
    .then(data => data.json())
    .then(data => {
      console.timeEnd('fetching data'); //pass the same string you use to start it
      console.log(data);
    });
// will reutrn the time it took to fetch the data 




console.table //remains important to take an array of objects and display them in a nice table
