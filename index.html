console.log(a); //console log will appear in dev tools 

//string is java is always surrounded by quotes. 
//"are okay" 'are okay' `are okay`
//backticks `` allow us to embed variables and expressions into a string with ${...}
let name = "John";

//embed a variable
alert( `Hello, ${name}`); // you get alerted "Hello, John"

//embed an expression
alert(`the result is ${1+2}`); //you get alerted "the result is 3"


//Boolean (logical type) has only 2 values: True or False
//these are used as Yes/No values often. (Yes=True//No=False)
let nameFieldChecked = true;//means Yes, the name field is checked
let ageFieldChecked = false;//means No, the age field is not checked

//Boolean can answer comparisons as well
let isGreater = 4 > 1;
alert(isGreater);//alerted "true"

//"Null" is a special value that represents "nothing" "empty" or "value unknown"
let age = null;//means that the age is unknown



//"undefined" works just like null. The meaning of "undefined" is "value is not assigned"
//if a variable is declared but not assigned then its value is "undefined"
let age;

alert(age);//shows "undefined"
//you can technically assign "undefined" to a variable
let age = 100;
age = undefined;

alert(age); //"undefined"
//THIS IS NOT RECOMMENDED. NULL IS USED TO ASSIGN "EMPTY" OR "UNKNOWN" VALUES
//UNDEFINED IS RESERVED AS A DEFAULT INITIAL VALUE FOR UNASSIGNED THINGS




object //is SPECIAL
//all other types are considered primitive because they can only hold a single thing(string or number or whatver)
object //is used to store collections of data and more complex entities. 
//more to come on "object" later
symbol //is used to create unique indentifiers for objects.
//also more on that later whe nwe get into object more.


typeof //will return the actual type of the operand
typeof undefined // will spit out "undefined"

typeof 0 // will return "number"
typeof true //will return "boolean"
typeof "foo" //will return "string"
typeof alert //will reutrn "function"
typeof(alert)//works the same and will return "function"

// typeof x    IS MUCH MORE COMMON AND RECOMMENDED


//!!!!below is a Summary!!!!

//THERE ARE 8 BASIC DATA TYPES IN JAVA
// 7 PRIMITIVE TYPES
Number //for both floating and integers
BigInt // for integer numbers of arbitrary length
String //for strings(strings can have 0 or more characters, there is no separate single character type)
Boolean // for True/False
null // for UNKNOWN vlaues..a standalone type that has a single value "null"
undefined // for UNASSIGNED value..a standalone type that has a single value "undefined"
symbol //for unique identifiers 
//and one non-primitive type
object // for more complex data structures


typeof //operator shows which type is stored inside a variable
