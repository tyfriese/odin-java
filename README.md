# odin-java is my notes page I made when going through the Odin Project Java section. These range from actual notes on the page to actual script language on the page. Color coordination helps visualize what the code can look like (depending on your color scheme for your text editor) and the notes help make some of the script stay interactive. I also am adding this for git testing.
